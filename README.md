### PROJECT ONE

- Your first task is to use California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. 
- This data includes metrics such as the population, median income, and median housing price for each block group in California. 
- Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). 
- I will call them “districts” for short.
- Your model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.
- The Objective of the business is that your  your model’s output (a prediction of a district’s median housing price) will be fed to another machine learning system along with many other signals 
- This downstream system will determine whether it is worth investing in a given area. Getting this right is critical, as it directly affects revenue
